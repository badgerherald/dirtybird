<h2>ASM overrun by reptilian shape-shifters</h2>


<p>With the recent Associated Students of Madison elections solidifying students' positions of power on campus, some have their beady eyes on a higher prize Ñ world domination.</p>

<p>After seeing ASM Chair Andrew Bulovsky attempting to hide his tail and cover a patch of scales on his face in a Student Activity Center bathroom last week, The Badger Herald has since uncovered that Bulovsky and at least 18 more student government members are Reptilian shape-shifters.</p>

<p>UW junior Natasha Borislow, upon hearing of the development, said she was baffled as to why reptilians would choose the bodies of ASM representatives in their quest to obtain world power.</p>

<p>"Wait, what even is ASM?" Borislow asked before googling it on her smartphone and audibly laughing. "These aliens are dumb asses."</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with the nameless reptilian overlord who has possessed world leaders like George W. Bush and multiple CNN reporters, he said he is now realizing his mistake in choosing University of Wisconsin student leaders to further his master plan.</p>

<p>"I sensed a lot of egos and thought they were actually powerful," he said. "I wasted, like, 20 of my best life forms on this. Fuck."</p>

<h2>Berquam chooses Slayer to headline Revelry </h2>

<p><strong>Sdf</strong></p>


<p>Dean of Students Lori Berquam surprised students Friday by adding the popular heavy metal band, Slayer, to the line-up of the spring festival Revelry.</p>

<p>Slayer will be the headliner for the Revelry Arts and Music Festival held at Union South on May 4th, according to Dean of Students Lori Berquam.</p>

<p>Many were surprised to discover it was Berquam's idea to book the band for the event.</p>

<p>"Slayer has always been one of my favorite bands," Berquam said. "Their music just echoes how I feel about everything ever."</p>

<p>Revelry Executive Committee Director Sarah Mathews said the committee was hesitant to approve the group, but came around when Berquam explained the musical style of the band fit well with the theme of the festival.</p>

<p>There is no better way to celebrate the end of the year than with such upbeat hits as "Eyes of the Insane" and "World Painted Blood," Berquam said.</p>

<p>Berquam added she hopes students will respond well to her headliner choice. Slayer will bring much needed musical diversity to this campus, she said.</p>

<h2>Ward new Adidas spokesperson</h2>

<img src="addidas.png" width="500px">
<p>Interim Chancellor David Ward will become the new face of Adidas, he announced at a news conference Friday.</p>


<p>"I had bought the new Adidas Sambas a week before coming back to campus and got to break them in on my daily walks up Bascom Hill," Ward said. "We had a contract worked out right away, but have been waiting for a chancellor selection."</p>


<p>Adidas sources confirmed Ward will be flying to Cancun, Mexico for a promotional photo shoot with fellow Adidas spokesperson Justin Bieber immediately after Rebecca Blank assumes her duties as chancellor.</p>


<p>Ward will also be featured in Adidas' next commercial campaign, due to his vocal talents. </p>


<p>"His British accent is so soothing," a high-ranking Adidas executive said.</p>


<p>A Student Labor Action Coalition member wearing a North Face jacket said Ward would now overtly be helping out a company that exploits workers.</p>


<p>The student then pulled out her iPhone to check a Snapchat and said, "This phone is literally the best thing that's ever happened to me. I love Apple products."</p>

<h2>PETA protesters take break, order McDonald's Big Macs</h2>

<p>After protesting in front of a University of Wisconsin lab in cat costumes for a day, members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals took a break to order Big Macs at McDonald's despite strong internal conflict over the treatment of chickens.</p>

<p>"I infinitely prefer Chicken Selects. May they rest in peace," PETA spokesperson Jeremy Beckham said.</p>

<p>In addition to protesting against UW's animal research ethic violations, PETA members are also bracing themselves for the fourth round of negotiation with University of Wisconsin Lab Cats for the right to legally represent the latter group.</p>

<p>The first two rounds of negotiations went well until Felix, executive director of UWLC, accidentally vomited a ball of fur during the third meeting and felt humiliated by reactions from PETA representatives.</p>

<p>According to a UWLC press release today, "The general impression of the special human interaction committee was that humans are just pretty stupid."</p>

<p>PETA will continue to fight for the right to represent UWLC and protest in more diverse cat costumes in the future, Beckham said.</p>

<h2>Soglin to host house party on Mifflin Street on May 4</h2>

<p>After years of struggling with how to keep the Mifflin Street Block Party under control, Mayor Paul Soglin announced Friday he will host a house party for the event.</p>

<p>In the past, Soglin expressed concern over the safety of the block party. He recently decided it would be in the best interest of the community to show his support for the event in the name of fun.</p>

<p>"If you can't beat Ôem, join Ôem," Soglin said.</p>

<p>Soglin said he made an agreement with five University of Wisconsin students who reside on Mifflin Street to host a party at their house. He said he will provide drinks for guests, and is still deciding on a way to monitor underage drinking.</p>

<p>Madison City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl said she is currently looking into the legal details of this act.</p>

<p>Joe Duncan, junior at UW, is one of the men allowing Soglin to host the party at his house.</p>

<p>"I was surprised when Soglin asked me to throw a party at my house for Mifflin, but I think it will be a good time," Duncan said. "I mean, whatever gets me free beer."</p>

<h2>Letter to the Editor:  Creator must confess sins</h2>

<p>Letter to the Editor: <strong>Pope Francis I</strong></p>

<p><i>Annuntio voibis tristitia magnum. Non habemus confessiones.</i></p>

<p>That's right. I, His Holiness Pope Francis I, have realized the truest evil facing the Catholic Church is the creation of a college student in the American state of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>This heretic, who calls himself "The Creator" has deemed himself the newest Vicar of Christ and has assumed the role of the primary intermediary between man and God.</p>

<p>Although my election as supreme pontiff may have been the most newsworthy occasion of last month's conclave, the College of Cardinals also discussed the crisis in Madison, which we have deemed to be the most pressing issue currently facing the Church. The Creator has already been excommunicated and will not receive the sacrament, but we have realized something else: No parishioners in Madison are attending confession anymore.</p>

<p>Instead, each of the darkest, most sinful secrets that were once privy only to the sacred bond between a parishioner and his priest are now out in the public view. The heretic receives regular payment for his antics because, my pious colleagues tell me, the clientele that patronize the site are "douchey."</p>

<p>We cannot continue this plunge into the depths of sin and Hell. We cannot continue to take confessions away from the only institution responsible for hearing them: the Church.</p>

<p>Oh, and since I'm lucky enough to get my letter published in The Badger Herald, would you publish my shout-out too?</p>

<p>"ASO to Prada. Why did Benedict get the cool shoes but I didn't?"</p>

<h2>Bruesewitz's hair actually wig</h2>
<img src="jerry.png" width="500px">

<p>After five years, Mike Bruesewitz has had enough.</p>

<p>A new report by UW authority Mike Lucas confirms Bruesewitz has come forward to admit that his various hairdos across the years have been, in fact, wigs.</p>

<p>"My natural hair color is actually brown," Bruesewitz tells Lucas in the shocking interview. "Nobody cares about another basketball player with normal hair."</p>

<p>Just trying to standout, Bruesewitz admits it was Bo Ryan who came up with the idea.</p>

<p>"Coach Ryan just said, ÔYou want to play don't you?' It all happened so fast. We were in a wig store before I knew it, and the rest was just a blur."</p>

<p>After various different wigs in looks called "tomato top," "Kraemer" and "redhead dreads," the Wisconsin senior said he is ready for life to go back to normal.</p>

<p>"You think I like looking like a douche all the time?" Bruesewitz said. "I might be one, but that doesn't mean I want to look like one!"</p>

<h2>Giant statue of Alvarez to be constructed </h2>
<img src="barry.png" width="500px">

<p>Barry Alvarez revealed plans Sunday for the construction of a giant, 50-foot golden statue built in his likeness.</p>

<p>The location of the monument? The middle of Camp Randall's field, of course.</p>

<p>"Let's be honest, ever since I've left I've cast a huge fucking shadow over this program," Alvarez said, redfaced at a local bar. "So, I figured, what the hell? Might as well make that shadow a literal one instead of a metaphor."</p>

<p>The pose of the statue will capture a stoic Alvarez carrying an entire coaching staff on his back.</p>

<p>"It just sort of describes how I felt before [football head] coach [Gary] Andersen took over here," Alvarez slurred. "It was like babysitting a bunch of high school football coaches here the last couple of years."</p>

<p>Wisconsin has held its football practices indoors with a giant pit in the middle of the field to simulate what play will be like with the statue on the field.</p>

<p>Already, the Badgers' David Gilbert has fallen in the pit and rescue teams are struggling to locate the defensive player.</p>

<p>"Ah, David disappeared last year," Alvarez joked.</p>

<h2>Athletic department reveals surplus</h2>


<p>For the first time in seven years, the University of Wisconsin's Athletic Department revealed a budget surplus to the Board of Regents Sunday.</p>

<p>"Just in the past three months alone, we've saved a million dollars," Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez said to the board. "Lately, we've seen a monumental decrease in the amount of money we've had to spend on feeding our coaches and players."</p>

<p>Upon a records request, The Dirty Bird found the reason for the surplus. The team has no longer ordered its expensive request of "A Shit Ton of Ribs" every month from the local eatery, Brickhouse Barbeque.</p>

<p>It appears the order was for the monstrous appetite of former football head coach Bret Bielema, whose favorite food was ribs. The coach could often be seen nibbling on a rib bone or with barbeque stains on his lips during and after practices.</p>

<p>In other news, farmers in Arkansas are on high alert for a large creature that "walks on its hind legs and breathes heavily out of his mouth" and is stealing their pigs.</p>

<h2>Bo Ryan's family reunion is methodical, effective </h2>


<p>As a 19-year-old freshman political science major and weekly viewer of CNN, I feel very qualified to share with my readers my opinions of the situation in Ukraine, although this is simply a campus newspaper in Wisconsin, and the conflict in which Ukraine and Russia are involved in is one of international proportions.</p>
 
<p>Regardless, the situation looks pretty bad. The world held its breath as we approached the brink of war, and America seized the opportunity to remain inactive (let’s not forget that Obama should be more assertive. Seriously, what is he doing?). Also, can we all agree that Putin seems like a villainous guy? He’s probably borderline evil, in fact. </p>

<p>Time for a quick digression: remember Syria? That situation was pretty bad too. What is happening to the world, really? Perhaps no country and no individual should have nuclear weapons. That could really solve lots of problems. Then there would be no wars and much world peace. Who doesn’t like peace? I definitely like peace, as do my political science professor and my parents. We all like peace. Peace.</p>
 
<p>If I was president, I would try to instill peace, help the homeless, solve world hunger, cure cancer and rectify every bad decision made by former presidents. And I would reign indefinitely because I’d be such a good president that the constitutional amendment restricting presidencies to two terms wouldn’t apply. Oh, and we’d just annihilate Russia.</p>
 
<p>And that’s my vision of the perfect world. We would lose Russia, but we’d have peace. When I run for president in 25-odd years, vote for me and my platform of peace.</p>

<h2>Sloppy Seconds</h2>

<p>My weekly schedule is one dedicated to the pursuit of academic excellence. Monday nights I stay in my dorm room in Sellery studying, Tuesday nights I stay in my dorm room studying, Wednesday nights I sometimes go to the SAC to study, but usually I am in my dorm room. Thursday nights I study in my dorm room, as with my Friday and Saturday nights too. Sunday nights I allow myself to watch Netflix for one hour — and then devote the rest of the evening to my studies. </p>

<p>That has been my life for the past seven months, and due to my constant presence in the dorm, I can’t shake this awful feeling that students on my floor are not in sync with my schedule, that, in fact, many don’t spend every evening studying like I do. I even think, and I may be bold in saying this, that my underage floormates are actually engaging in illegal activities, specifically the consumption of alcohol and, quite possibly drugs on many weeknights. And the worst part? The one authority figure on my floor, my house fellow, is in on it. He drinks with them. </p>

<p>I may be putting myself in danger by writing this, but word of this needs to reach the right ears in order to instill the necessary change. This drinking conspiracy is bigger than you, bigger than me, and it needs to end. Let’s work together to save Sellery and bring the collective BAC back to my level, zero. Our futures, and the future of this great nation, are at stake, should this illicit activity continue.</p>

<h2>Band violence prompts venue action </h2>

<p>With every Bucky baseball hat or bro tank emblazoned with the Motion W you buy, sources revealed Monday that you’re pouring money into one of the most elaborately camouflaged and expansive drug ring fronts in history — the University of Wisconsin Athletics Department.</p>

<p>Little did thousands of season ticket holders, brat stand vendors or student-athletes know, they’ve been cogs in an international drug scheme peddling cocaine, methamphetamine and PCP around the globe for years.</p>

<p>The news broke after a night custodian at Camp Randall happened upon a trapdoor in the women’s locker room, revealing a network of tunnels running under the football field and surrounding grounds. When Drug Enforcement Agency officials arrived at the scene, they seized some 20 tons of pure methamphetamine (valued at about $3.5 billion); 30 tons of cocaine with a street value $800 million; and nearly 200 gallons of PCP valued at $175 million — records enough to easily secure its status as the largest drug bust of all time. </p>

<p>“No comment,” Athletic Director Barry Alvarez said after reporters chased him to his car, a large black van with opaque windows Monday afternoon. He added ominously: “Tread lightly.”</p>

<p>DEA spokesperson Dan LePonne lauded the agency’s efforts bringing down an operation supplying drugs for the entire continental U.S., Canada and parts of Mexico.</p>

<p>“These fat cats are a classic example of finding in plain sight,” he said. “What better way to launder drug money than through a $100 million pseudo-corporation that’s well-loved by brainwashed fans but operates as a cold, calculating entity completely divorced from the university?”</p>

<h2>Band violence prompts venue action </h2>

<p>In a close game between a red team and a white team, the red team won Saturday night after getting more points than the other one.</p>

<p>The ultimate score at the end of the basketball match was 64-63, which shows the game was close. If the white team would have scored two more points, they would have won. But they did not.</p>

<p>At one point, a player wearing a red tank-top ran really fast, and got to the ball before anyone else. He must have gotten a good night’s sleep the night before, or maybe he drank some Gatorade or something. Anyway, he ran really fast and scored a basket probably because he ran the fastest. </p>

<p>The red team threw the ball at the basket from the half circle-shaped line a lot of times, but seemed to have trouble with their throwing and jumping technique. One of the players looked frustrated, and that was kind of sad. Hopefully he’s ok now, since his team won the game.</p>

<p>While the red team played better and harder than the white one, both teams did share some similar strategies. Both teams seemed to sweat a lot, and their coaches yelled many times and made silly faces. All of the players also jumped at least a few times and every player’s shoes made squeaking noises. </p>

<p>Really, in the end it was likely the fast running and good jumping that brought the red team success despite missing the far away shots. Now they get to go on a road trip maybe, which sounds pretty sweet.</p>

<h2>Band violence prompts venue action </h2>

<p>The Wisconsin men’s hockey team announced Saturday that it will play an outdoor exhibition game on Lake Mendota in May as part of a month-long celebration of the careers of nine seniors.</p>
 
<p>Ironically enough, Wisconsin’s opponent for the game will be University of Miami (Fla.) — not to be confused with Miami (Oh.), a team the Badgers faced earlier this season — the warm weather football giant that apparently recently introduced a hockey team into its athletic program.</p>
 
<p>Badgers’ head coach Mike Eaves addressed the upcoming event, saying at a time in college hockey when outdoor games have become dull and run-of-the-mill events, the UW Athletic Department has invested time and effort to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
 
<p>“When Barry [Alvarez] told me the game was a go I could hardly believe it. College hockey and the marvels of modern science have come such a long way since I played here over 30 years ago,” Eaves, who was a Badger skater from 1974-1978, said.</p>
 
<p>Although the game could not be staged on Mendota during the regular season due to the occupation of the lake by a group of local bullies, nicknamed the “Mighty Mites,” the length of the Wisconsin winter and the water quality of the lake allows it to remain frozen year round making the May game a reality.</p>
 
<p>“At first when I heard about the game I thought coach [Eaves] was joking. He kind of gets this weird smile after he tells you stuff sometimes, and I thought he was just trying to pull one over on me, because what lake is still frozen in May? Then I remembered it’s Lake Mendota,” senior forward Patrick Johnson, still suffering from post-concussion syndrome, said.</p>
 
<p>It’s still yet to be determined how the specifics for the event will work or if anyone actually believes that the event can happen without interference from freak weather events like the thawing of the lake. Relatedly, questions of player safety have also arisen, but Eaves assured everyone that if a player can make a split-second decision with the puck he will know what to do if he caves through the ice.</p>
 
<p>Eaves also announced that Wisconsin will sport brand new uniforms for the event that include red water wings on the sleeves and skates that resemble miniature pontoons.
 Fans interested in seeing the game from a new perspective also have the opportunity to purchase tickets for the floating section behind the eastern goal that includes an inner tube complete with a beer koozie.</p>
 
<p>“This is going to start a new age in college hockey. If you know how to swim, you’re not going to want to miss this game,” Eaves said. </p>

<h2>Band violence prompts venue action </h2>

<p>In a disturbing exposure late last Friday afternoon, several tutors and other members of the Wisconsin Athletics Academic Services revealed that more than 100 Badger athletes in cross-country, rowing, swimming and diving, among other non-revenue sports have actually been completing their own course work and somehow managing to succeed.</p>

<p>A distraught Barry Alvarez spoke about Wisconsin’s scandal Friday night at a press conference, stating he could hardly believe his Badger athletes had the audacity to do their own work.</p>
<p>“I thought [the athletes] knew their place here at Wisconsin, but I guess I’ve been wrong before,” the Athletic Director said, pausing to admire the glimmer of his three Rose Bowl rings, all of which were on one finger. “These kids are here to win games, win championships, not waste time in the classroom.”</p>

<p>“If we had kids like they have over at North Carolina, athletes who know their priorities, we’d probably have won the cross-country National Title this year and the women’s swimming team would have been right near the top at the NCAA Championships.”</p>

<p>Of the little information known so far about the scandal, it appears to have been a diligent individual effort with little to no collaboration between athletes and the different sports teams.</p>

<p>“I just don’t know how something like this could happen. To think that they wanted to do well in school and get a degree … it hurts,” Alvarez said, making note of the 98 percent graduation rate of the cross-country teams. “This is a trying time for Badger athletics.”</p>

<p>An athlete, who wished to remain anonymous for the story out of fear of losing his scholarship, said that he and his teammates regularly attended office hours for help understanding more difficult concepts and to build a better rapport with professors. They also had only used tutors when they needed an extra set of eyes for a paper and rarely did those tutors change anything besides small grammatical errors.</p>

<p>With such a prevalent scandal strongly rooted in the moral values of the athletes, Alvarez belabored the point that fixing the behavior will be a long and arduous task. He ultimately believes that with some careful and less transparent work of those within the athletic department, the non-revenue athletes can be brought back up to the standard of the football and basketball players.</p>

<p>“I truly believe we can get these kids to understand that winning is the most important lesson they can learn in college and you don’t need a degree to be a winner,” Alvarez said. “Work in the classroom won’t help them learn that lesson. The work on the field and in the weight room is all that matters.”In a disturbing exposure late last Friday afternoon, several tutors and other members of the Wisconsin Athletics Academic Services revealed that more than 100 Badger athletes in cross-country, rowing, swimming and diving, among other non-revenue sports have actually been completing their own course work and somehow managing to succeed.</p>

<h2>Sex advice from UW betch</h2>

<p>Hey, sexy Badgers! We’ve got a ton of questions flooding into the inbox, so we’re gonna get to a couple of the juiciest ones right now. My pussy is wet with anticipation of answering these, so let’s get started before I squirt all over these term papers I’ve got sitting in front of me.</p>

<p>Hi!!! Love your column. My bf really wants us to start role-playing but I just think it’s too weird! What should I do here? Thx.</p>

<p>Role-playing is a big step in any sexual relationship. I encourage an open dialogue between you and your partner. Find out what kinds of characters turn him on. Similarly, think of characters who turn you on: Elementary school teacher? That hot second cousin? Leonardo DiCaprio in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?” Anything goes.</p>

<p>For me, nothing gets me going quite like acting out my kinky days back in Witte. I’ll have my RA put on his best suit and pretend to be Bucky. Then he drills me in all my holes and cums all over my back! </p>

<p>Hey. I really want to start having sex outside and in public places. Do you have any advice on how to have good public sex or where to do it?</p>

<p>You’re talking to the reigning queen of public sex. Every Friday night for the past eight months, I’ve held orgies behind Bascom Hall starting at 10 p.m. They’re B.Y.O.B. and mostly faculty, some students. There’s nothing quite like getting all wet and sweaty with my professors and maybe even some deans.</p>

<p>I’ve also fucked numerous partners in Union South’s Marquee Theater; the third floor of the Capitol Building; Abe Lincoln’s lap; the living room of Sigma Alpha Epsilon; and, of course, the Terrace (only during wintertime).</p>

<p>My advice for good public sex is to find a place and have sex there.</p>

<p>I’m a freshman at UW with a girlfriend who’s really into poop, like in a sexual way. She says she wants to poop on my chest during sex. Is this normal?</p>

<p>Of course. I love it when my boyfriend shits all over my face. Yum!</p>

<h2>I took Adderall and went to College Library</h2>

<p>This Sunday, in anticipation of writing a 10-page paper for an anthropology class, I took 30 mg of Adderall before heading to College Library for an excruciating test of mental endurance.</p>

<p>I started off the essay-writing process by standing in front of the library. I stared down at the three pills lying in the palm of my sweaty hand, where they sat motionless. A wind rustled through my hair. It was a peculiar wind, one that seemed to whisper, “This is your destiny.” I put the pills in my mouth and washed them down with some cold Dr. Pepper.</p>

<p>I walked to the front doors, then stopped.</p>

<p>“Fuck yeah, motherfucker,” I said.</p>

<p>Then I walked in.</p>

<p>I found a table on the third floor and set up my work station. I opened a Word document and typed my name in the top left corner.</p>

<p>“Fuck yeah. Good start,” I whispered to myself.</p>

<p>I spent 20 minutes trying to highlight stuff in my textbook, but couldn’t focus. Then it hit.</p>

<p>“Fuck yeah,” I said.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was typing like a monkey on Adderall with a keyboard in front of his face and a looming paper deadline. I didn’t know if what I was writing was good, but at least I was writing. Fuck yeah.</p>

<p>As I plowed through scholarly articles about Central African tribes, I stumbled across a picture of topless African women. Instant blood flow below the belt. I needed to attend to this.</p>

<p>I spent two-and-a-half hours furiously jacking off in the men’s bathroom stall. It was only after I realized that two hours had passed that I thought I should get back to my paper.</p>

<p>I came all over the toilet seat.</p>

<p>“Fuck … yeah,” I said under my breath.</p>

<p>Back to my work station. It was now four in the morning. My paper was halfway done. I knocked off two more pages, then passed the fuck out. I woke up at 8:30, 20 minutes before my paper was due. Went to class and turned in an incomplete essay lacking any sort of conclusion and probably glaring grammatical mistakes.</p>

<p>All in all, Adderall is fucking tight.</p>
